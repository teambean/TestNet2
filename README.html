<h2>What Is Bean Cash?</h2>

<p>Bean Cash (Ticker: BEAN) is a re-brand of BitBean (Ticker: BITB).
Bean Cash brings forward BitBean's legacy, of a lightening-fast, rock-solid network, with a
mature blockchain--that is nearly 3 years old! 3 years is a long time in the "crypto-currency"
space! In this time, BitBean has not had a hardfork or transaction roll-back. Bean Core will
continue to move development forward with Bean Cash, while working to maintain the integrity
of the blockchain. As core developers of Bean Cash, Bean Core sees its role as a steward.
Integrity of a currency is of foremost importance. The very first purchaser of BitBean (that may have transfered their BitBean to a Digital Cash "paper wallet"), should be able to redeem those same number of tokens 90 years later, as "Bean Cash". If
this is possible in 90 years, then Bean Core and developers of Bean Cash, will have filled
the mission:  <q>To be an enduring digital currency, with high integrity, a store of value <b>and</b>
a means of exchange of value in every day transactions -- that stands the test of time!</q>
</p>

<p>Bean Cash is a digital currency and network, designed for scalability,
speed, and lightening fast transactions! It features an innovative Proof of Bean (PoB)
algorithm that more closely resembles traditional Proof of Work (PoW) crypto currencies.
Bean Cash is the first digital currency to implement a maximum of 20MB blocks, based off Gavin Andersen's
proposals to fix Bitcoin's scalability limitations. Bean Cash is designed from the ground-up
to be a transaction-centric and superior form of currency, for exchange of value in on-line
purchases (idealy suited for micro-transactions) and purchases with traditional
brick-and-mortar merchants.
</p>

<p>In it's mission to be a transaction-centric digital currency with real use, one
of the main goals for Bean Cash, is solving the "last mile" issue in the digital currency space.
Instramental in this objective will be working with companies that are willing to implement
Bean Cash at the Point of Sale/Service. Bean Cash is designed to support a network with over
1,300 TPS (Transactions Per Second), effecively being able to compete with companies such as
PayPal.
</p>

<p>As developers of Bean Cash, we are not looking to re-impliment a transaction system, based on
the "Check/Cheque" model (et al. Bitcoin), where a merchant approves a transaction based on
simple verification, and settlement happens much latter. That kind of model does not provide
any more value than existing, charge back prone, credit cards.
</p>

<p>Rather than use archaic models of the past, Bean Cash will allow merchants to verify, validate
and settle transactions in near real time (a minute or less on average for a single confirmation
transaction.) This is magnitudes faster than Bitcoin (10-30 times, or substantually more if
transactions are back-logged), while providing no risk, with transactions being posted in near
real time to the Bean Cash blockchain. This provides real value by allowing  merchants to reduce
risk, fraud, and costs as their percentage of Bean Cash transactions increases in their business.
Fundamently, a zero confirmation transaction does not help to solve a real-world problem,
as merchants still bear risk as with existing traditional payment methods
(checks/cheques/Credit-Debit cards).

<h2>Bean Cash Specifications</h2>

<p>It is the goal of the BitBean developers for everyone involved in the Cryptocurrency revolution to have access to the exciting developments that have been taking place. An ASIC-friendly, mixed PoW/PoS coin with eventual anonymous transaction capabilities has been sorely overlooked.</p>

<p>The BitBean developers believe that progress should never be held back.
Proof of Stake Crypto-currencies use a considerably smaller amount of energy and
allows everyone to be involved in the network, without prohibitively expensive
propriatary hardware as required to mine Bitcoin. The energy used mining Scrypt
beans for years to prolong the days of GPU mining was a truly enormous waste of
resources on a global scale. Why hold back progress? BitBean encourages it,
allowing everyone with even a small investment in BitBean to participate in the
network and currencies success!</p>
